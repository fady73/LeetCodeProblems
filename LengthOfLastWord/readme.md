Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return *the length of the **last** word in the string.*

A **word** is a maximal

substring

consisting of non-space characters only.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "Hello World"
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The last word is "World" with length 5.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The last word is "moon" with length 4.
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "luffy is still joyboy"
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
* `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
* There will be at least one word in `s`.

Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
